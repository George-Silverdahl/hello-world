# hello-world
For my beginner self:

SO, today is Oct. 26, 2019. I've almost completed the first section of freeCodeCamp and find myself struggling still.I understand the concepts well enough to be dangerous, but the mecganics and all the dress-up stuff is still a little elusive. Im hoping this will be a helpful tool in helping me understand.
